# Handwritten Digit recognition
### The Handwritten Digit Recognition project aims to build a Machine Learning model capable of recognizing and classifying handwritten digits accurately.
### The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled images containing handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Once trained, the model should be able to predict the correct digit when presented with new, unseen handwritten digit images
### We used  different Deep Learning techniques to achieve a high-performance 
### We developed an Artificial Neural Network & Convolutional Neural Network, but we got the highest performance from the CNN with 99% test accuracy . 

#### Hope Usefully ^-^
